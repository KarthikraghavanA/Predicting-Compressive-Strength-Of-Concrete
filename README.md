# *Machine Learning 4 - Predicting Compressive Strength Of Concrete* 


In This Project, we will check Cement Manufacturing Industry, We will predict the **Compressive Strength Of Concrete** using 15+ different algorithms by doing a lot of Featurization, Model Selection and Tuning to get the best model.
<br>


We will also be doing Data Preprocessing for data exploration, Check Outliers, Feature Engineering, Model Building

## Dataset :
Concrete Compressive Strength

## Domain : 
Material manufacturing

## Description: 
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

## Objective : 
Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning

## Steps : 
This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

## Machine Learning Task : **Regression**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a couple of challenges like model overfitting, non important features but we can go ahead and with **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
